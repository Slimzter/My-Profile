<h2 id="My Profile">My Profile</h2>
<p>

My name is Eric Sandberg and I come from Sweden. This is my second time in Australia and I have been here for 4.5 years now. Prior to Australia I also lived and studied in Shanghai where I received a degree in Hotel Management. Beside speaking my native langue Swedish and English I also speak a bit of Mandarin. <p>

My personal interested are spending time with my family and friends, music and sports.          I decided to start to study again as I would like to change my career. I’ve always been interested in the IT world and been considering a career change for some time, now I’m very happy that I can finally study and hopefully have a career in an industry that I'm very interested in.<p>

As this is my first-time studying IT and online, I would like to gain knowledge in every aspect of the industry. I’m currently working full time as a customer service agent were social interactions, communication and participations is important.
My interested in IT started when I was young; my father showed me how to build computers. He started his IT business in the early 90’s and was trying to get me interested in building website etc. Even though I showed interest at a young age, I didn’t think about it as a career it was more like a hobby. For most of my life I been working in the Hospitality industry but for the last year or two I have been wanting to change my career path. Since the pandemic been having a massive effect on the hospitality industry, I realised that I needed to think hard about finding a career that I would enjoy but also would be essential.<p> 

A friend of mine is currently studying Bachelor in IT at RMIT. Because we are in a similar situation, both are working full time and have children I realised if he can do it so can I.
He was very friendly to guide me through the application process and to show me some tips and tricks that would come in handy.<p>

Since I stopped showing interest in IT in my early twenties and are coming back to it some 15 years later, I realise that the industry has developed tremendously, I expect to gain knowledge in all aspects of the exciting world of IT. Realize that I can’t learn everything but at least basic skills are what I aim for. Also, since I have gotten my passion back for IT and are more mature, I think and hope that it will come easier to me this time.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-family:calibri;font-size;30px;color:green"><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52460229?type=standout#searchRequestToken=d3db1229-f90a-48bf-ab64-b24ff3dbc3db" target="_blank">Job Advertising Link</a></p>
<p>
My goal is to work in the Cyber security industry. There are many reasons why, I have friends who are working as cyber security analyst and based on what they have told me and my own personal research I find the industry very interesting. I believe that cyber security is showing an ultimate growth potential both career path and learning. Also, it’s very flexible, you can work from home or at the office. Then I can’t deny that the salary and potential earnings is very attractive as well. That’s why my ideal job is to become a Cyber Security Manager.<p>

For the position you are required to have around 10 years’ work experience in a similar role. Testing security assessments and auditing. Several skills in various governance framework. Managing and overseeing your team. Show excellent communication skills to both internal staff and clients.<p>

For most of my professional life I been working in the Hospitality Industry. I obtained a bachelor degree in Hotel Management from Les Roches in Shanghai. Les Roches is one of the top 3 Hotel Management Schools in the world (1. About Les Roches n.d.). After my studies I worked in both Sweden and Australia as a Front Office Manager. I gain experience how to manage and motivate a team. Customer service is very important and I have learned how to develop my communication and service skills in a professional way.<p>

I believe if you are good to manage a team, you can carry that with you in any industry shape of form. People skills and how to deal with certain people is very important. At first, I thought my hospitality skills would be useless in the IT industry but upon doing research, I realise that you need customer service and people skills in other industries as well. The adverting of my ideal job is nothing different. I plan to gain knowledge by studying a Bachelor in IT here at RMIT and then hopefully find a job as a Cyber Security Analyst. Or if I can’t find a job based on my experience I tent to build on my education and continue study for a Master degree in Cyber Security. Or while I’m working as a Cyber Security Analyst study to obtain a higher degree in the same industry. This will probably give an advantage later on in my career while applying for a manager position.<p>

<p style="text-align:center">I started off by doing the Myers-Briggs test, below are the results:</p>

It was interesting to take this test as I haven’t done any in a very long time. I feel that the results are accurate and describes me as a person.

Based on the results and knowing myself I’m more of an observant in the team. I tend to listen more than to take intuitive. Saying that though I participate and input ideas when opportunities are given.<p>   

When forming a team, I have to take that in to consideration. In my team I need a person who can take a bit more intuitive and be the leader. Even though I have managed teams before in my professional life, I feel more confident doing so when I have gain knowledge and experience.<p>


<h2 id="Project Idea">Project Idea</h2>

<p>
Nowadays people use maps on their smartphone on regular basis. Maps are available and free. What was expensive and required the user to get a paper copy in a shop is now available on any smartphone. Have you ever found yourself lost at a shopping mall when trying to find a store or where your car is park? Shopping malls have evolved with time and made the shopping experience easier for the customer. For example, carparks are marked or painted in different colours as well as signs to make this easier for the customers to be aware of their whereabouts. Also, most larger shopping centres have a map located inside the mall where you can find your store and directions. All though all this is very handy and helpful, I was thinking that a detailed map with other unique features on your phone would be more ideal.<p>

<p>Shopping malls are getting bigger and bigger, as the population growth the demand for products and services are expanding. In today’s fast pace society people have less time on their hands, an application which gives you detailed information and navigation of your mall would be a good idea and beneficial for people. Especially for those who travels and found themselves in an environment they are not familiar with. I myself have been in that situation numerous times and would have saved a lot of time and stress having an app like that.<p>

<p>The application would be available to download on your smartphone from either platform that you are using, Android or iPhone. You can either download it from your app store or directly from the shopping centres website. As Westfield shopping centre is one of the largest and most popular in Australia, (5. About us n.d.) I decided to use them as an example. When you are opening the app for the first time you can create your profile very quickly, this will be useful later on when I will describe some features within the app. The application will have a build in map similar to other online maps but more in depth and detailed.<p> 

<p>When you open the app, you first select the shopping centre you are currently visiting. To use the navigation tool simply select your store from the shortlist or search using the search engine. As you are logged in with your profile you can save your favourite store and simple select the store to get the navigation. The application also shares news and promotion from the different department stores that you have selected. Each department store has their own profile in the application, where you can find all the products that they are selling. A unique feature is that the customers can see the stock level of each product. If it’s an item that you really want this will come in handy as you can see prior if its available or not. A wallet is also available in the application. Customers can add their credit card and use the build in wallet for their purchases.<p>

<p>Instead of going to a single store website to check for the latest offers or products all the different department store will have their data base uploaded to the application. This will be a unique offer for the customer to have all the stores information in one place. Also, as the service will only be available for Westfield clients there are some exclusive deals and discounts that the customer will receive while using the app.<p> 


<p>The navigation tool already exists in some ways. Other companies have created shopping malls maps before for example Mapspeople.com (6. Mapspeople – Indoor navigation & Google Maps Platform n.d.), but still most people are not using it. Also, there service and features within the app is very limited. We are all aware about google maps as most of us are using it these days. A good feature that they provide is when traffic congestion starts. The navigation line turns red to show the customer where the traffic is moving slow.<p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="Screen Shot 2021-06-13 at 7.24.35 pm.jpeg" alt=Myers-Briggs test" style="width:500px;height:500px;">
<p style="text-align:center">(7. B Christopher / Alamy Stock Photo 2017)<p>

<p>Similar service will be provided with this application instead of traffic it will be people. For example, you have probably walked in to a specific store and not be able to move as freely as normal because it was very busy and crowded. When using the navigation tool, every department store is lighting up with a different colour depending on the movement. A very busy store will be turning red to indicate that you maybe should come back later if you don’t want to shovel your way through the aisle. Personally, I think this is a good feature as I hate to go to places were its very busy.<p>

<p>The technology will be an inbuild app that will gather data and sources from the different department stores and an in -build navigation system. I decided to use Bubble as the application builder as they are a fast-growing company that lets you build an app without coding. (8. The best way to build web apps without code n.d.) There will be an inbuild Global Positioning System (GPS) tracker that can detect the moment of the customers within shopping centre, therefore the GPS tracker can suggest that you should go to a store if another one is too busy and are showing red lights.<p>

<p>To be able to implement and build this application you need a professional software like Bubble witch I mentioned before. The hardware that are being used is any smartphone were the customer can download the application and use the GPS receiver that can receive signals from a satellite. (9. How Does GPS Know When There Is Traffic? 2018)<p>

<p>I personally think the application will benefit the customers as their shopping experience will be much easier and time efficient. Not only will the GPS system provide navigation for the user but also demonstrate the moments of everyone inside the shopping centre. This unique feature is very important especially nowadays during the Covid-19 pandemic where many people are scared to be around crowded gatherings. The stock list will also help the customer tremendously. People can use the application to check the stock take prior and therefore during the ongoing pandemic can decide to go or not. 
Shopping online is getting more popular especially in the last year or two but many people still would like to go out and socialise. I believe that this application will provide a better service and safety while visiting a shopping centre.<p>
